# FilesRename

**How to use FileRename?**

Download the script and move it to the directory in which you'd like to rename the files.
Open the script in an editor and change the "name" variable to your preference. 
Then run the script. (all files and directories will be renamed!)
If you want to revert the changes add "#" at the beggining of line 8 and remove the one at the beggining of line 7.
